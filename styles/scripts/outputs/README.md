This is most usable within VSCode terminal.

You can just `cat "src/themes/testing/scripts/outputs/color hex codes in swap dir.txt"` or `cat "src/themes/testing/scripts/outputs/color keywords in swap dir.txt"`, or execute the desired script (`chmod +x path/to/script` and `path/to/script`). Then in VSCode terminal you can always tap the path and it opens the file and line where it was found.
